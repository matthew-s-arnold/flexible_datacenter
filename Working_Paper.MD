How IT Strategy Limits Medium Sized Businessâ€™ Access to the Cloud: 
Letting Go of the Past to Succeed in the Future 

## 1. Introduction

Cloud computing continues to be popular with businesses, evidenced by its increasing sales (Columbus, 2016). Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle, and others continue to migrate their software and services from a traditional model to a cloud model (Giret, 2016). Cloud services allow information technology (IT) departments to scale up and down as needed, provide almost limitless resources, and reduce the need for large capital purchases. Small businesses, that cannot justify the costs of installing and maintaining a data center, are now able to run enterprise level IT services. On the opposite side, large businesses, which have multiple data centers around the world, can reduce costs by migrating entire data centers to the cloud (Krazit, 2015). 

### 1.1 Medium Sized Enterprise

While small and large business are able to realize the benefits of cloud computing, through gaining access to enterprise IT and closing unneeded data centers respectively, medium sized businesses may be faced with a challenge when it comes to the cloud. For the purpose of this paper, medium sized businesses are organizations that have a dedicated IT staff, run a single onsite data center, and have technical, financial, or regulatory requirements that force at least some services to remain onsite. Maintenance costs of the local data center and continued capital costs for equipment may make it difficult to take full advantage of cloud services, absent an increase in IT spending.
