## The Business Case

I have often been told going to the cloud will increase costs in the short term, and at first blush it seems like a plausible statement. The company has thousands to millions of dollars of capital equipment in the data center and then must pay for cloud services at the same time. Capital heavy hardware and software costs does not lend itself to drawing down the services and seeing a cost savings quickly. 

What does a company do that wants to take advantage of cloud computing but does not have extra budget in the short to medium term period? It is a question I have heard many times and one I have had to deal with as well. The purpose of this working paper was to analyze how a medium sized business can shift financial and personnel resources to the cloud while staying budget neutral.

## Abstract - Flexible_datacenter

Spending on cloud computing continues to rise and is not expected to flatten out until 2025. Cloud computing allows businesses to focus resources and capital on their core competencies. While small businesses are now financially able to gain access to enterprise level IT and large businesses can shut down entire data centers, medium sized businesses are faced with a challenge. The challenge is to maintain the data center while freeing up resources to use for cloud expansion. Medium sized businesses must change their data center strategy in order to be compatible with the cloud. This new strategy includes eliminating traditional SANs, blade servers, large tape libraries, and other systems that are heavily interdependent on each other. Eliminating these types of systems will free up financial resources and create a more agile data center.
